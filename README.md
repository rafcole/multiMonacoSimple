# nested_crdt_provider_playground
This was a research spike to explore state synchronization and nesting issues specific to the Yjs CRDT implementation when there are multiple editor bindings. It was instrumental in deciding to make the Pennant Notebook project architecture based on client/server model rather than the default peer to peer model. The nested data occupies considerably less disk space because of the nature of self referential nature of Y documents. The result is a consolidated abstract data type which is much easier to work and much more performant than isolated one crdt per text editor/notebook cell
